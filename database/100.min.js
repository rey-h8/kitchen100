If you can't find a black rice, just use wild rice.Give the veggies, rice and lentils a stir and then add your veggie broth, water, kale, spinach and all of the spices and turn the heat to high.Keep the burner on high just until the soup boils, reduce the heat to low and cover for 25 minutes. Covering the soup will ensure that the lentils and rice cook thoroughly.After the soup cooks covered for 25 minutes, remove the cover and continue to cook on low for another 30 minutes or so.  I added another 1/2 tsp of salt and a bit of pepper for flavoring at this point and it was a perfect balance.After the final 30 minutes of simmer, simply serve and enjoy!",ingredients:[{id:10011457,name:"spinach",localizedName:"spinach",image:"spinach.jpg"},{id:0,name:"green lentils",localizedName:"green lentils",image:"lentils-brown.jpg"},{id:10020036,name:"black rice",localizedName:"black rice",image:"black-rice.jpg"},{id:4053,name:"olive oil",localizedName:"olive oil",image:"olive-oil.jpg"},{id:20088,name:"wild rice",localizedName:"wild rice",image:"rice-wild-uncooked.png"},{id:11124,name:"carrot",localizedName:"carrot",image:"sliced-carrot.png"},{id:10316069,name:"lentils",localizedName:"lentils",image:"lentils-brown.jpg"},{id:11143,name:"celery",localizedName:"celery",image:"celery.jpg"},{id:11215,name:"garlic",localizedName:"garlic",image:"garlic.png"},{id:1002030,name:"pepper",localizedName:"pepper",image:"pepper.jpg"},{id:2035,name:"spices",localizedName:"spices",image:"spices.png"},{id:1006615,name:"broth",localizedName:"broth",image:"chicken-broth.png"},{id:11282,name:"onion",localizedName:"onion",image:"brown-onion.png"},{id:1006615,name:"stock",localizedName:"stock",image:"chicken-broth.png"},{id:14412,name:"water",localizedName:"water",image:"water.png"},{id:11233,name:"kale",localizedName:"kale",image:"kale.jpg"},{id:11246,name:"leek",localizedName:"leek",image:"leeks.jpg"},{id:20444,name:"rice",localizedName:"rice",image:"uncooked-white-rice.png"},{id:2047,name:"salt",localizedName:"salt",image:"salt.jpg"},{id:0,name:"soup",localizedName:"soup",image:""}],equipment:[{id:404752,name:"pot",localizedName:"pot",image:"stock-pot.jpg"}],length:{number:117,unit:"minutes"}}]}],spoonacularSourceUrl:"https://spoonacular.com/spicy-lentil-and-black-rice-soup-with-kale-spinach-and-leek-661122"},{vegetarian:!0,vegan:!1,glutenFree:!0,dairyFree:!1,veryHealthy:!0,cheap:!1,veryPopular:!1,sustainable:!1,weightWatcherSmartPoints:8,gaps:"no",lowFodmap:!1,aggregateLikes:2,spoonacularScore:91,healthScore:98,creditsText:"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit",license:"CC BY 3.0",sourceName:"Foodista",pricePerServing:213.91,id:658087,title:"Red Quinoa and Roasted Cauliflower Salad",readyInMinutes:45,servings:4,sourceUrl:"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/22QVP2CY/red-quinoa-and-cauliflower-salad",image:"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/658087-312x231.jpg",imageType:"jpg",summary:'Need a <b>gluten free and lacto ovo vegetarian main course</b>?
